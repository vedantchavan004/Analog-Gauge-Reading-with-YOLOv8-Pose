# 📟 Analog Gauge Reading with YOLOv8-Pose

This project demonstrates how to use a YOLOv8 pose estimation model to detect keypoints on analog gauges and calculate pressure values based on the needle's angle. It uses a custom synthetic dataset in COCO keypoint format and is designed to run efficiently in Google Colab.
